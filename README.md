<ul>
<li>1.1.1</li>
</ul>
<p>Flirtatious Notes:<br />New maps are being made with FX Master, Community Lighting, and Dynamic Illumination modules if you're interested in a more immersive scene I'd recommend using them in conjunction with our maps.</p>
<p>Changelog<br />Added Garden Party map to FF General Scenes<br />Added Library map to FF General Scenes<br />Added Bar map to FF General Scenes<br />Added Trollskull Manor New Owners map<br />Added Trollskull Manor Abandoned map<br />Added Trollskull Manor Renovated Minus Bedrooms map<br />Added Trollskull Alley map<br />Removed all old Trollskull maps</p>
<p>Release Notes: This module is going to shift focus a bit to concentrate more on maps, both in quality, and quantity. My lovely wife also makes maps for Foundry, and while I'm more of a DnD mapmaker since I run the campaign,she is much better with random, and themed maps. So stay tuned, and visit our patreon!</p>
